something weird going on with states - 
    - sidenav is setting thread state on render but shouldn't be.
    - problem to do with map?

     -wrapped use effects in if statements to prevent them being triggered on render.

individual thread fetch not working. 
    - Call is not correct, don't know how to correct it.
    - Calling all posts instead of filtering per thread.

    added req to thread controller

    - doesn't work until second button clicked, then works fine

    - component state not being cleared on page state change. Implemented state reset to fix issue.
