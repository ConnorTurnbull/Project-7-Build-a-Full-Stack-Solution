something weird going on with states - 
    sidenav is setting thread state on render but shouldn't be.
    problem to do with map?

    wrapped use effects in if statements to prevent them being triggered on render.

individual thread fetch not working. 
    Call is not correct, don't know how to correct it.
    Calling all posts instead of filtering per thread.

    added req to thread controller 

First thread button not always working
    doesn't work until second button clicked, then works fine

    component state not being cleared on page state change. Implemented state reset to fix issue.

package props together?

next week:
