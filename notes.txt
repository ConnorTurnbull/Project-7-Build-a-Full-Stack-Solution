something weird going on with states - 
    sidenav is setting thread state on render but shouldn't be.
    problem to do with map?

don't know how to do backend for subscribe feature

individual thread fetch not working. 
    Call is not correct, don't know how to correct it.
    Calling all posts instead of filtering per thread.
