DONE:

Delete account not working
    - syntax error, changed deleteOne to destroy in User controller.
Signup function not working properly
    - reverted changes made in session and added proper prop pass-through
    - not sure how this was working in the first place without pass-through?
        
TO DO:

Finish read/unread functionality:
    Cannot implement conditional rendering per state at present - just doesn't work can't fix.
    
Fix user threads in side nav
    - Same threads displaying for all users even when not subbed
    - check logout function in case not clearing session properly




Fix delete account Dropdown
 - staying open when used

Styling for mobile devices
    Managing page height between states / pages?
    - min-height
