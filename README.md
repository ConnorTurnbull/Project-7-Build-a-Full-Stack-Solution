Your director, Stephanie, invites the entire agency for a drink to celebrate some good news! She has just signed a contract for a new ambitious project! ðŸ¥‚

The client in question is Groupomania, a large group and one of the most loyal clients of the agency.

The project will be to build an internal social network for Groupomania's employees. The goal of this tool is to facilitate more interaction between colleagues. Groupomania's HR department has envisioned two applications for promoting exchanges between colleagues. Otherwise, theyâ€™re allowing for a lot of flexibility regarding the functionalities of the network.

Stephanie describes the proposed apps, and you realize that these are spin-offs of products that already exist:

- 9GAG, because they want employees to share and comment on gifs with other colleagues.
- Reddit, because they want employees to write and/or share articles with colleagues on topics of interest to them.

Stephanie puts you in charge of the project. Youâ€™ll need to analyze the clientâ€™s needs and develop an initial functional version. She explains that sheâ€™ll send you further details.

Shortly thereafter, you receive the following email from her:

>Hello,

>Glad to have you on this exciting new project!

>I was able to get Groupomaniaâ€™s HR manager to agree to have a Groupomania employee test a minimal version of the tool with only one of the two apps. The benefit on their end is that this will promote the adoption of the tool internally. The benefit on our end is that this will ensure weâ€™re on track with their expectations before we jump into developing the second app. So youâ€™ll need to deliver an initial functional version of just one of the two apps theyâ€™ve envisioned. Feel free to choose whichever of the two interests you more, but let me know your decision asap.

>Attached youâ€™ll find Groupomaniaâ€™s user requirements specifications detailing the minimum features expected for each app. Theyâ€™ve also provided a file with the company's logos. 
>
>Please note that Groupomania expects the application to meet high standards of security and accessibility. The only other constraint to be aware of is that they currently use SQL for their data store. As for the front-end, you should use React as it's the framework they use for most of their applications.

>Since the project parameters seem to be in flux, I think taking an agile approach would be the best suited, allowing us to react efficiently to any feedback we get from the client during the project lifecycle. I recommend using a kanban tool like Trello to plan and estimate the time youâ€™ll need for each of your tasks and track the projectâ€™s progress. Once you have a functional version of an app ready, Iâ€™d like to briefly discuss how you managed your tasks so that I can start getting a sense of your workflow.
